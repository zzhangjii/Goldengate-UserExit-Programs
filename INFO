Basically we use CUSEREXIT in an extract, and it calls a custom exit routine in C that must take certain 
exit parameters from GG while calling GG callback subroutines for retrieving record and application context 
information & modifying the contents of data records.

There are actually example C programs for user exits in the GG installation.  
I have taken a look into the code, and they are pretty involved.  
I would definitely need some help in understanding on where to get started on 
converting a DDLOP into a token (and then presumably applied by GG to ADW in the replicat).  



Other than conversion into a GG token, it may be also be possible to directly apply the DDLOP on ADW via OCI in the custom routine
